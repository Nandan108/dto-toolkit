# DTO Toolkit Core

A lightweight, framework-agnostic toolkit for defining, transforming, and validating **Data Transfer Objects** (DTOs) in PHP.

This package provides a clean, declarative API for working with DTOs ‚Äî including input normalization, output transformation, and attribute-based type casting ‚Äî all without coupling to a specific framework.

## ‚ú® Features

- üß± Minimal and framework-agnostic
- üè∑Ô∏è Attribute-based casting system with flexible resolution
- üéØ Optional validation and normalization layers
- üîÑ Easily transform between DTOs and entities/models
- üß© Designed to work with pluggable framework adapters (Laravel, Symfony, etc.)

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
composer require nandan108/dto-toolkit
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

```php
use Nandan108\DtoToolkit\Core\{FullDto, CastTo};

// FullDto includes all standard traits (CreatesFromArray, NormalizesFromAttributes, ExportsToEntity)
class MyDto extends FullDto {
    #[CastTo\Trimmed()]
    public ?string $name = null;
}

// Build DTO from array
$dto = MyDto::fromArray(['name' => '  Alice  ']);

// Transform into an entity
$entity = $dto->toEntity();
```

Use a framework adapter (e.g. Symfony or Laravel) to unlock request/response integration and validation support.

## üì¶ Core Namespace

If you're not using a framework, start with:

- `Nandan108\DtoToolkit\Core\FullDto`
- `Nandan108\DtoToolkit\Core\CastTo`

These provide a convenient, framework-free entry point with all standard functionality included.

## üß© Adapter Packages

- Laravel Adapter: [`nandan108/dto-toolkit-laravel`](https://github.com/nandan108/dto-toolkit-laravel) *(not started yet)*
- Symfony Adapter: [`nandan108/dto-toolkit-symfony`](https://github.com/nandan108/dto-toolkit-symfony) *(in progress)*

Adapters will provide support for:
- Validation using framework services
- `fromRequest()` DTO hydration
- `toEntity()` or `toModel()` adapter-specific hydration
- `toResponse()` generation
- DI for class-based casters resolution
- Graceful handling of validation and casting exceptions in HTTP contexts, with standardized API error responses

## üß≠ Design Philosophy

This toolkit is built on a simple idea: **do the most work with the least number of moving parts**.

It favors:
- **Declarative code** over procedural boilerplate
- **Clever, expressive syntax** without falling into obfuscation
- **Minimalism with power** ‚Äî clean by default, extensible when needed
- **Framework-agnostic design** with optional adapters that integrate smoothly when needed
- **Zero magic** in the core ‚Äî everything is traceable, explicit, and predictable
- **Opt-in magic** in adapters ‚Äî for just the right touch of convenience when working with frameworks
- **Separation of concerns** and **composability** ‚Äî inspired by the Unix philosophy of doing one thing well
- **Performance-conscious by design** ‚Äî DTOs should feel lightweight and fast to use, even in large batch transformations.

Verbose code is a tax on your time. This toolkit aims to keep things sharp, concise, and purposeful ‚Äî so you can focus on what matters.
