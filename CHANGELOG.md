## [UNRELEASED]

### Added
- New **caster modifiers**:
  - `#[FailTo(fallback, handler)]` wraps upstream casters in try/catch
  - `#[FailNextTo(fallback)]` wraps only the next caster in the chain
  - Both support graceful fallback or custom exception handling
- New **conditional casters**:
  - `#[CastTo\IfNull($value)]` â€“ replaces `null` with a default
  - `#[CastTo\NullIf($match)]` â€“ replaces a matched value with `null`
  - `#[CastTo\ReplaceIf($when, $then)]` â€“ replaces matched values with custom output
- New **unified integer caster**:
  - `#[CastTo\Integer(IntCastMode::*))]` supports `Ceil`, `Floor`, `Round`, `Trunc`
  - Removed `CastTo\Ceil` and `CastTo\Floor` in favor of this consolidated approach
  - Added `IntCastMode` enum to support integer casting strategies

### Changed
- Refactored `CasterChainBuilder` into its own support class
- Updated `PerItem` modifier to use the new chain builder internally
- All core casters now always throw on invalid input
- Improved attribute resolution and chaining logic

### Dev / DX
- Added `nunomaduro/collision` for improved CLI error reporting
- Minor `.gitignore` and `phpunit.xml.dist` updates

## [v0.2.1] - 2025-04-19

### Added
- Support for multiple `#[CastTo]` attributes per property (caster chaining)
- `CastModifier` interface for attributes that modify the behavior of casters in the chain
- New `#[PerItem]` modifier to apply the next N casters to each element of an array

### Changed
- Refactored `CastTo::getCastingClosureMap()` to support middleware-style caster chaining
  - Introduced `CastTo::buildCasterChain()` to compose casting pipelines
  - Introduced `CastTo::sliceNextAttributes()` to assist modifier behavior

ðŸŽ‰ This version lays the foundation for advanced casting scenarios with full chain control.

  - Replaced legacy `CanCastBasicValues` trait with modular caster attribute classes
  - Retained support for method- and class-based casters using `#[CastTo('methodOrClass')]`
- Added `CastBase` base class to support shared logic and optional dependency injection via `#[Injected]`
- Introduced `CastingException` for structured error handling during cast operations
